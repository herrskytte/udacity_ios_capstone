# Udacity IOS Capstone Project
Udacity IOS Nanondegree Project 6: Capstone Heroes

This is my final app for Udacity and its focuses on the marvelous heroes of the Marvel Universe.
Connect to Marvels API and search for heroes or get a random set of heroes each time you open the app!
View a big version of the heroes image and store your favorite heroes into an easily browsable collection.
Your favorites are of course available offline!

# App instructions
The app-code can be checked out and ran "as-is". 
Download the code, open the project in XCode and you should be able to build, compile and run the app.
Enjoy!
